            <h2>Mice and Spoons</h2>
            <p>For a mouse to get an entire day's worth of water intake from a spoon, it would need less than one full spoon. 5.8 mls of water would be roughly 40% of 
               a tablespoon's full 14.8 mls capacity.</p>
            <h2>Yaks and Spoons</h2>
            <p>For a yak to get an entire day's worth of water intake from a spoon, it would need nearly 2,302 spoons. That's a lot of spoons!</p>
